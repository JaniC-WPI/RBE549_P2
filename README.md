Overall Inputs and Outputs of the Model are as below:




# Implementing Guidelines:

# For Training 

Code - python3 Train_NeRF.py

After training a checkpoint named model.ckpt will be saved. After that you can implement the below code for the Testing.

# For Testing

Code - python3 Test_NeRF.py

After testing an output video will be saved named as Output_NeRF.mp4 and loss graph will be saved in NeRF_Output folder.
